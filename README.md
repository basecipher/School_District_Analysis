# School_District_Analysis
Student grade analysis using Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

Written with Python, Panda, Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Project
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold

### Purpose
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
1. Math and reading scores by grade:  gave the illusion that district students where doing fine with passing results when really they weren't.
2. Scores by school spending:  The more was spend the better students performed.
3. Scores by school size:  Smaller school sizes renedered better performing students.
3. Scores by school type:  Charter schools produce better results than district.

## Resources

* Python 3.7.6, Conda 4.9.0
* Data Source:  students_complete.csv
                schools_complete.csv

## Summary
After making the requested reading and math score replacement request we determined that the lion's share of the funding should go into mathematics remediation classes for the District students to bring them up to speed.  Charter Schools are fine.
